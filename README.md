## Overview

### What is the goal of this project?

I've made this project to make practice React.js skills and to build a project. So why the weather app? Because building a weather app is really useful to improve how to deal with geolocation. The Weather app already is a well-known popular app.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Onload show their location's forecast
- Finding city's forecast by searching their name
- Show dynamic backgrounds in order to weather
